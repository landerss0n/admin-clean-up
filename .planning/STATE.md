## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Code quality fixes must precede UI work (deep merge bugs would be harder to debug with new UI)
- Roadmap: CSS custom properties from the start for WordPress 7.0 compatibility
- Roadmap: All 9 tabs migrated together (no partial migration -- inconsistent UX)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- WordPress 7.0 (April 2026) may introduce design tokens -- CSS custom properties hedge against this
- Exact nested option array structure needs mapping during Phase 1 planning
