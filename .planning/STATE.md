# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Code quality fixes must precede UI work (deep merge bugs would be harder to debug with new UI)
- Roadmap: CSS custom properties from the start for WordPress 7.0 compatibility
- Roadmap: All 9 tabs migrated together (no partial migration -- inconsistent UX)
- 01-01: Use class constant for option key (centralized string management, prevents typos)
- 01-01: Recursive merge over wp_parse_args() (fixes nested defaults bug)
- 01-01: Activation defaults match get_options() structure (complete 45-key initialization)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- WordPress 7.0 (April 2026) may introduce design tokens -- CSS custom properties hedge against this
- ~~Exact nested option array structure needs mapping during Phase 1 planning~~ RESOLVED: 01-01 documented complete structure (9 tabs, 45 keys)
